# üìå Project Title: Rule-Based Financial Transaction Fraud Detection
Rule-Based Financial Transaction Fraud Detection
# üß† Objective:
To identify potential fraudulent transactions using simple yet effective rule-based logic, followed by evaluating performance with visual analysis and confusion matrix.
# üìÇ Dataset:
‚Ä¢ **Dataset Used**: PaySim Synthetic Financial Transactions Dataset

‚Ä¢ **Records**: ~6.3 million transactions

‚Ä¢ **Key Fields**: amount, type, isFraud, oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig
# ‚öôÔ∏è Approach:
## 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

‚Ä¢ Checked distribution of transaction types and amounts.

‚Ä¢ Found a heavy skew: most transaction amounts are small, with few large outliers.

‚Ä¢ Fraudulent transactions were mostly concentrated in 'TRANSFER' and 'CASH_OUT' types.

## 2. Defined Rule-Based Logic:
    df['isSuspicious'] = (
        (df['type'].isin(['TRANSFER', 'CASH_OUT'])) &
        (df['amount'] > 200000)
    ).astype(int)

‚Ä¢ Chose a threshold based on distribution and fraud concentration.

‚Ä¢ This logic assumes high-value transfers/cash-outs are likely suspicious.
## 3. Evaluated Rule Performance:
‚Ä¢ Used confusion_matrix from sklearn to compare predictions vs actual frauds.

‚Ä¢ Visualized true positives, false positives, etc.
## 4. Visual Insights:
‚Ä¢ Created a bar chart showing:

    ‚Ä¢ Total frauds

    ‚Ä¢ Frauds caught by the rule

    ‚Ä¢ Missed frauds
‚Ä¢ Helped communicate the rule‚Äôs effectiveness and its limitations.

# üìä Results:
| Metric	       |       Value    |
|----------------|----------------|
|Total Frauds	   |    e.g., 8213  |
|Frauds Detected |	    e.g., 4652|
|Frauds Missed	 |      e.g., 3561|
|Precision (Rule)|	 ~95% (varies)|
|Recall (Rule)	 |  ~56% (varies) |

_**‚ÄúRule-based approach caught a significant portion of actual frauds with high precision, but missed some ‚Äî highlighting the need for deeper techniques like ML in future versions.‚Äù**_

# ‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Rule-based detection is a good starting point for fraud analytics, especially in domains where explainability matters.

‚Ä¢ This project helped me explore how simple logic can be evaluated with visual and statistical validation.

‚Ä¢ It also built a foundation for scaling to machine learning-based fraud detection in the next iteration.
